With an initial starting value of $1,000,000 CAD, we aim for the overall portfolio to move with the index. We have combined both indexes to compare them equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this portfolio, we had 3 main parameters used to rank each stock. The first parameter was tracking error which measures how much a stock deviates from an index. Ideally, we wanted to choose stocks with tracking errors as close to 0 as possible whether it be below or above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we analyzed stocks using Beta. Beta measures a stock’s volatility compared to an index’s volatility. We want to choose stocks with a Beta value as close to 1 as possible since a beta value of 1 represents the same volatility for both the index and the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we checked the correlation between each stock and the index. Correlation measures how 2 securities move in relation to one another. We want to choose stocks that have correlation values as close to 1 as possible. We want to avoid stocks with a negative correlation since they historically have had the reverse effect on trying to meet the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will weigh these 3 parameters equally and rank our stocks with a score of 0-1. From then we will optimize our portfolio which will contain between 12-24 stocks based on the tracking error of our portfolio compared to the index."

    "\n",
    "To meet the market, we have to establish a combined benchmark that will act as the index we are trying to meet. Since our returns would be compared to the simple arithmetic average of both the S&P 500 and the TSX 60 indexes combined, we decided to look at weekly returns for both indexes over a certain period of time and then take the average of the two for each week. We then stored the weekly returns of the combined benchmark into a data frame to be used in our analysis after. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we needed to prepare stock data to compare to the combined benchmark we created. So we decided to create a similar data frame that has the weekly returns for each stock from the same time period. This way, when doing analysis after, we can compare each stock or a combination of stocks against the index based on their weekly returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the analysis, we chose to represent weekly returns as a percentage instead of value-based returns as percentage-based returns are independent of currency denomination, avoiding the need for currency conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to use data from the past year as it is the most relevant data to current market trends and economic conditions. 1 year of data also includes different earnings seasons, holiday effects, annual economic events and other parts of the market cycle which is sufficient for our analysis. If we used older periods we could include trends that are not relevant today such as a bull market or large amounts of growth in a specific industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to use weekly data as it avoids daily market fluctuations that may be overly volatile or 1-day news events that could heavily affect the performance of a stock. Since we are testing data for a year, weekly data also gives us 52 data points rather than 12 if we were to use monthly data. This gives us better statistical reliability and makes our data less sensitive to outliers. Since we'll be investing for 1 week, it's important to use data within the year, however, if we were looking at a long-term portfolio, we could analyze monthly data instead to get a larger spread of data.

    "## Parameter 3: Correlation Between a Given Stock and Index\n",
    "### What is correlation?\n",
    ".corr() is a Pandas function that calculates Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. PCC finds a pairwise correlation between 2 variables (given as 2 columns in a dataframe). PCC measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between these variables. It can output a number between -1 to 1, where the sign indicates direction (-1 indicates a negative correlation, +1 indicates positive correlation) and the value indicates strength (if |PCC| = 1 then the correlation between the 2 variables is a perfect linear correlation. If PCC = 0 then there is no correlatio.) The close PCC is to 1, the more exact of a linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it important?\n",
    "When we find the correlation between a stock and a benchmark (in this case, the index), we find whether the stock moves in the same direction as the index or not. This is important because we want stocks that move similarly to the index to be valued more. Therefore, later on, when we rank the stocks by giving each stock a rating, we can factor correlation into that rating by prioritizing stocks with better correlation."

MMN is a form of normalization that brings a data set to a range of 0-1, where the lowest value in the set is 0 and the highest value is 1. We do this for each test so we can get their outputs onto the same range (since each test can return different value ranges). \n",

Using these scores, we can now rank these stocks in order of best to worst."

    "### How do we weigh each stock in the portfolio?\n",
    "Given a dataframe of ranked stocks, we can begin to assign weights. The first thing we apply are the base rules from the project outline. Each stock must weigh at least 100/2n% of the portfolio (where n is the number of stocks in the portfolio). Once the base weights have been distributed, we can now distribute the rest of the portfolio weight based on stock scores.\n",

    "Finally, we ensure that no stock is weighted more than 15%. This is done by taking whatever excess weight has been distributed to the stocks weighed more than 15% and passing it to the first stock that has less than 15% weight in the portfolio (and so on until all the weight has been redistributed). Since the stocks are given in ranked order, the weight will always be redistributed to the best stock weighted under 15%. This way, we maintain the skew of good stocks being a higher weight in the portfolio than bad stocks."

    "Since we might have stocks in both CAD and USD, we need to appropriately calculate the number of stocks to buy. To do so, we convert the close price from USD to CAD and calculate from there. We also calculate which fee to pay and how that affects the 1,000,000 budget we have. Our fee options were to pay a flat fee of 3.95 or a variable fee of 0.001 per share. We calculated the number of shares we could buy given both fees and took the larger share count. Finally, we pull stock information, such as currency and close price, directly from yFinanc\r\n",
